# DataScienceProject

**Overview of the Project**

This project shows a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) of exoplanetary systems using a curated dataset derived from NASAâ€™s Exoplanet Archive. The primary objective of this analysis is to investigate the relationships between key planetary and stellar features and the discovery methods used to detect these exoplanets. 

A series of visualizations have been employed to extract meaningful insights from the dataset. 

These analyses highlight that certain methods, such as Transit are more sensitive to detecting smaller or closer-in planets while methods like Radial Velocity and Imaging tend to identify more massive or distant planets. Such biases must be accounted for in any downstream modeling tasks, such as classification or regression, to ensure generalizability.

The results of this EDA not only provide a comprehensive understanding of the underlying data but also serve as a foundation for future work, including machine learning model development and methodological bias correction. All data analysis and visualization were conducted using Python.
